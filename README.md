## Intro

* Bitcoin has been around as early as 2009 with the emphasis of blockchain technology under the use case of Proof of Work. Proof of Work describes a system that requires significant amount of effort to perform at a high malicious use of power. Due to proof of work, Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrency transactions are processed peer-to-peer in a secure manner without the need for an intermediary party. Transactions are handled by miners who use an extreme amount of energy. In turn the more miners, the better for Bitcoin but worse for your average retail/institutional buyer who transacts with Bitcoin.

## Is Bitcoin Worthy of investment?

Even though Bitcoin's price is somewhat inflated you are still able to invest using dollar cost averaging by investing in fractions of Bitcoin versus one Bitcoin. These fractional investments could eventually become an increase
